It is alright to learn and make mistakes when the risks are small so that you will have learned from those lessons and have become an expert in personal finance in the future!</div>

        <div class="about-us-text">When we were teenagers, we were overwhelmed with all the different banks, accounts and didn't know where to start. We wish we had a friend that could help us walk through some of the confusing banking terms, provide us with easy-to-follow tips to guide us. This is exactly what we want to accomplish with Finance Bestie. Tailored towards young girls who have zero or very limited knowledge about finance, our avatar Erika take them through interactive scenarios of choosing a bank, bank accounts, and spending and saving their money. </div>
